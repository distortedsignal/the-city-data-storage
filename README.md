the-city-data-storage
=====================

Getting data from The City's API and persisting it to a database. Maybe something else?

To get started:
---------------

Install Ruby. If you're on Windows, get this from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ . This was developed targeting 2.1.5.

If you're on Windows, install the Ruby DevKit. This can be retrieved from the previous link.

Install the JSON gem. Do this by running `gem install json` in a terminal.

The script should be runnable at this point. If it is not, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/DistortedSignal/the-city-data-storage/issues).
